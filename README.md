# Alcohol-Detecting-System
The primary goal of the project is to implement a system on vehicles which detect the alcohol level.
This project is done as part of MINI PROJECT at Meerut Institute Of Engineering And Technology.
The system uses an Arduino,alcohol sensor and buzzer. The Arduino (microcontroller) on encountering high alcohol signal from the alcohol sensor indicates alcohol detection through buzzer and stops the Fan to demonstrate as engine locking. When alcohol is detected after engine starting, the system locks the engine at that time.


## Components Used:
- Arduino uno
- MQ3 Alcohol Sensor
- LCD Display
- Motor
- Power supply
- Buzzer
